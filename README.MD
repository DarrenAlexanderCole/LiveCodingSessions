A user can create an organization using an object-oriented style approach. I made two classes. One is called Org and has a list of methods to help filter employees, find the managers of said employees, and a recursive function to display the organization at every level.

The other class I created is called Employee, which has a constructor of the first name, last name, id, and managerId. List of functions to help get manager, set managers id, get the ID of current Employee as well.
